# Vegetarian Pizza Research
### Xavi Pi

Exploration of what makes a great vegetarian pizza. 

## Inspiration
I love vegetarian pizza and The Cheeseboard. Since I'm under quarantine and can't get any, I figured I would make my own using insights from the Cheeseboard pizza itself.

## Use
1. Open jupyter notebook.
2. Uncomment first blocks if you'd like to gather data again.
3. Otherwise, start with veggie_menus_4.csv

## Thanks
